# Gradebook Assistant (Part 2)

## Assignment

Your task is to build a front-end application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application will act as a tool that a teacher could use to track and sort the grades from a classroom test. Over time, you will continuosly build upon this application by adding new features and improving old ones.

In part two, you will create a GitHub repository to implement version control on your project. You will also create a project board to track issues for this project. You will invite your instructors to the repository so that they may view your code when necessary.

Additionally, you will add a feature that allows you to leave the page and come back without losing your work. Finally, will add a delete button so that a students test score may be deleted from the list.
